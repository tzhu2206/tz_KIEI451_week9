  // Implement the like function
  // Step 2:  Parse out the like data, i.e. the event.body â€“ pull out
  //          the user id and the post id that is provided
  //          in the POST request, and assign to variables. Use
  //          console.log if necessary, to ensure the values are what
  //          you're expecting.
  // Step 3:  Check in the firestore collection to see if the user has
  //          already liked the post before adding a new like.
  // Step 4:  If there's no likes with the given post id and user id,
  //          add the like to Firestore using the .add() function.
  // Step 5:  Modify the return so that the body is different based on
  //          whether a new like was added or not. Any distinction is ok
  //          so long as the frontend will be able to identify which occurred.
  //          (optional) Use a relevant status code.
